              <p>My name is <strong>Nick DeMarco</strong>. I grew up in Long Island, New York, raised by an Italian father and a mother whose Irish roots ran deep through my grandmother, <strong>Nana Mae</strong>.</p>
              <p>Like many families of that era, heritage was everything during the holidays. Christmas Eve meant honoring tradition — the Italian way. We'd attempt the classic <em>Feast of the Seven Fishes</em>, though we adapted it to suit our tastes: <strong>scungilli, calamari, shrimp</strong>, and whatever else we loved. My brother's wife hated seafood, so there was always chicken on the table too. It was never about perfection. It was about being together.</p>
              <p><strong>Nana Mae</strong> would come stay with us around the holidays. Sometimes she lived with us for stretches of time. <strong>Aunt Eileen</strong> too. The house would fill with voices — laughing, arguing, storytelling. We were an emotional family, Italian and Irish blood running hot. There were good times and hard times, but what I remember most is the warmth.</p>
              <p>And every Christmas Eve, after the food was cleared and the table was set fresh, we played <strong>Bingo</strong>.</p>

              <p>Before there was code, before there were sound cards and luggable computers, there was <strong>Nana Mae</strong>.</p>
              <p>Nana was Irish and proud of it. She loved her heritage fiercely. But nothing — <em>nothing</em> — compared to how much she loved Bingo.</p>
              <p>Nana Mae didn't just enjoy Bingo. She <em>lived</em> for it. Bingo was joy, anticipation, community, and ritual all rolled into one. When my wife <strong>Cathie</strong> and I would visit Nana in Orlando, one of the highlights was taking her to a local bingo hall. Sitting beside her, watching her light up as the numbers were called, you could feel how something as simple as Bingo brought people together.</p>
              <p>She also taught me how to argue. How to debate. How to hold my ground. I think of her often, and I miss her deeply. She passed around 1996, but her spirit lives on in every game we play.</p>
              <p>Cathie likes Bingo too — but no one loved it like Nana. That love planted a seed.</p>

              <p>My mother, <strong>Marge</strong>, was the director behind the scenes. She was the one who made everything happen. Every Christmas, she'd go out and buy a collection of small, thoughtful, fun prizes. She'd set the table, organize the games, gather the family together.</p>
              <p>Pop built the technology. But Mom built the moment.</p>
              <p>She was the unsung hero of every Christmas gathering. The one who turned chaos into tradition. The one who made sure everyone felt welcome, fed, and loved. Without her, the Bingo games — and so much else — would never have come together.</p>

              <p>My dad, <strong>Nick DeMarco</strong>, was a successful business owner who worked relentlessly to provide for his family. But he wasn't just a businessman — he was a problem-solver, a builder, and someone who loved learning new things.</p>
              <p>In the mid-1980s, he decided to pursue a lifelong dream: <strong>learning to fly</strong>. Through his friend <strong>Frank</strong>, who worked at Grumman, my dad joined a private pilot club called <strong>GACE</strong>. The club operated a small fleet of Cessna 152s and 172s. Like many clubs at the time, scheduling was painfully manual — you had to drive to the airport, check a paper schedule, and hope a plane was available.</p>
              <p>My dad saw the problem. And he fixed it.</p>
              <p>Using a piece of ISA hardware called <strong>Big Mouth</strong> — a voice playback board — along with MS-DOS and his own programming skills, he built a <strong>telephone-based aircraft scheduling system</strong>. He called it the <strong>QTS Scheduling System</strong>.</p>

              <p>I grew up hearing him develop it. Over and over, I'd hear his voice echoing through the house:</p>
              <p class="story-quote"><em>"Sierra Foxtrot..."<br/>"November Three Four Seven..."<br/>"Cessna One Seven Two..."</em></p>
              <p>The military phonetic alphabet. Tail numbers. Scheduling prompts. Recorded again and again until they were perfect.</p>
              <p>At the time, honestly? It was kind of annoying. Hearing the same phrases repeated endlessly while he got the recordings just right.</p>
              <p>But now that he's gone, those memories are precious. That voice — patient, deliberate, unmistakably his — is something I'll never forget.</p>
              <p><strong>The same voice that once called airplane tail numbers would later call Bingo numbers.</strong></p>

              <p>The QTS system was deployed at GACE, and members loved it. So much so that he went on to sell copies to other flying clubs. His work was even written up in a private pilots' magazine — a proud moment that reflected how far ahead of the curve he truly was.</p>

              <p><strong>Why not build a Bingo caller?</strong></p>
              <p>If Pop could build a telephone scheduling system using his own recorded voice, he could certainly build a Bingo caller. So he did.</p>
              <p>Using the same core ideas behind QTS, my dad built a <strong>Bingo Calling Application</strong>. He recorded his own voice calling <em>every single Bingo number</em>. Each call was stored individually, mapped perfectly, and played back by the computer.</p>
              <p>When Bingo started, it wasn't a generic voice. It was <strong>Pop</strong>. Calling every number.</p>
