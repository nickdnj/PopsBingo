              <p>Nana Mae <em>loved</em> Bingo. Not casually — she lived for it. Bingo was joy, anticipation, community, and ritual all rolled into one.</p>
              <p>When my wife <strong>Cathie</strong> and I would visit Nana in Orlando, one of the highlights was taking her to a local bingo hall near her home. Sitting beside her, watching her light up as the numbers were called, you could feel how something as simple as Bingo brought people together.</p>
              <p>That joy planted a seed.</p>

              <p>My dad, <strong>Nick DeMarco</strong>, was a successful business owner who worked relentlessly to provide for his family. But he wasn't just a businessman — he was a problem-solver, a builder, and someone who loved learning new things.</p>
              <p>In the mid‑1980s, he decided to pursue a lifelong dream: <strong>learning to fly</strong>.</p>
              <p>Through his friend <strong>Frank</strong>, who worked at Grumman, my dad joined a private pilot club called <strong>GACE</strong>. The club operated a small fleet of aircraft, including Cessna 152s and 172s, and like many clubs at the time, scheduling was painfully manual.</p>
              <p>If you wanted to reserve a plane, you had to physically drive out to the airport, check a paper schedule, and hope something was available.</p>
              <p>My dad immediately saw the problem. And, as he always did, he decided to fix it.</p>

              <p>This was the mid‑1980s. Personal computers were primitive. There was no internet. No mobile phones. No cloud.</p>
              <p>But my dad discovered a piece of ISA hardware called <strong>Big Mouth</strong>, a voice playback board. Using it, along with MS‑DOS and his own programming skills, he built something remarkable: a <strong>telephone‑based aircraft scheduling system</strong>.</p>
              <p>Members of the GACE club could call in by phone, listen to spoken prompts, and reserve aircraft without ever driving to the airport.</p>
              <p>He called it the <strong>QTS Scheduling System</strong>.</p>
              <p>The system was deployed at GACE, and members loved it. So much so that my dad went on to sell copies of QTS to other flying clubs. His work was even written up in a private pilots' magazine — a proud moment that reflected how far ahead of the curve he truly was.</p>
              <p><em>This was interactive voice technology, built by hand, years before it was commonplace.</em></p>

              <p>Every Christmas, our family had a tradition. We played Bingo.</p>
              <p>Mom would go out and buy a collection of small, thoughtful, fun prizes. The whole family — kids, grandkids, everyone — would gather together. It wasn't about the prizes. It was about laughter, excitement, and being together.</p>
              <p>And my dad had an idea.</p>
              <p>If he could build a telephone scheduling system using his own recorded voice… <strong>why not build a Bingo caller?</strong></p>
              <p>So he did.</p>
              <p>Using the same core ideas behind QTS, my dad built a <strong>Bingo Calling Application</strong>. He recorded his own voice calling <em>every single Bingo number</em>. Each call was stored individually, mapped perfectly, and played back by the computer.</p>
              <p>When Bingo started, it wasn't a generic voice. It was <strong>Pop</strong>. Calling every number.</p>

              <p>Bingo became more than a game.</p>
