              <p>My name is <strong>Nick DeMarco</strong>. I grew up in Long Island, New York, raised by an Italian father and a mother whose Irish roots ran deep through my grandmother, <strong>Nana</strong>.</p>
              <p>Like many families of that era, heritage was everything during the holidays. Christmas Eve meant honoring tradition — the Italian way. We'd attempt the classic <em>Feast of the Seven Fishes</em>, though we adapted it to suit our tastes: <strong>scungilli, calamari, shrimp</strong>, and whatever else we loved. There was always chicken or lasagna for family that didn't like fish. It was never about perfection. It was about being together.</p>
              <p><strong>Nana</strong> would come stay with us around the holidays. Sometimes she lived with us for stretches of time. <strong>Auntie</strong> too. The house would fill with voices — laughing, arguing, storytelling. We were an emotional family, Italian and Irish blood running hot. There were good times and hard times, but what I remember most is the warmth.</p>
              <p>And every Christmas Eve, after the food was cleared and the table was set fresh, we played <strong>Bingo</strong>.</p>

              <p>That Christmas Eve Bingo tradition? It all started with <strong>Nana</strong>.</p>
              <p>She was my Nana — my mother's mother. Years later, when the great-grandkids came along and my mom became "Nana" to them, we started calling her <strong>Nana Mae</strong> to tell them apart. But to me, she was always just Nana.</p>
              <p>Nana was Irish and proud of it. She loved her heritage fiercely. But nothing — <em>nothing</em> — compared to how much she loved Bingo.</p>
              <p>Nana didn't just enjoy Bingo. She <em>lived</em> for it. Bingo was joy, anticipation, community, and ritual all rolled into one. When my wife <strong>Cathie</strong> and I would visit her in Orlando, one of the highlights was taking her to a local bingo hall. Sitting beside her, watching her light up as the numbers were called, you could feel how something as simple as Bingo brought people together.</p>
              <p>She also taught me how to argue. How to debate. How to hold my ground. I think of her often, and I miss her deeply. She passed around 1996, but her spirit lives on in every game we play.</p>
              <p>Cathie likes Bingo too — but no one loved it like Nana. That love planted a seed.</p>

              <p>My mother, <strong>Marge</strong>, was the director behind the scenes for decades. Every Christmas, she'd go out and buy a collection of small, thoughtful, fun prizes. She'd set the table, organize the games, gather the family together.</p>
              <p>Pop built the technology. But Mom built the moment.</p>
              <p>Now at 86, she's slowed down a bit — and has graciously passed the torch. My sister <strong>Peggy</strong>, my sister-in-law <strong>Eileen</strong>, and my wife <strong>Cathie</strong> have stepped up. Their families are picking up the mantle. Peggy's son <strong>Kevin</strong> lives in upstate New York. My brother's kids — <strong>Nicky</strong>, <strong>Ashley</strong>, and <strong>Joey</strong> — still live near home and gather for Christmas Eve.</p>
              <p>And the circle keeps growing. My nieces and nephews, their spouses and significant others — they're not just winning prizes now, they're buying them too. Everyone's part of the tradition. Everyone's part of the process.</p>

              <p>My dad, <strong>Nick DeMarco</strong>, was a successful business owner who worked relentlessly to provide for his family. But he wasn't just a businessman — he was a problem-solver, a builder, and someone who loved learning new things.</p>
              <p>In the mid-1980s, he decided to pursue a lifelong dream: <strong>learning to fly</strong>. Through his friend <strong>Frank</strong>, who worked at Grumman, my dad joined a private pilot club called <strong>GACE</strong>. The club operated a small fleet of Cessna 152s and 172s. Like many clubs at the time, scheduling was painfully manual — you had to drive to the airport, check a paper schedule, and hope a plane was available.</p>
              <p>My dad saw the problem. And he fixed it.</p>
              <p>Using a piece of ISA hardware called <strong>Big Mouth</strong> — a voice playback board — along with MS-DOS and his own programming skills, he built a <strong>telephone-based aircraft scheduling system</strong>. He called it the <strong>QTS Scheduling System</strong>.</p>

              <p><strong>Why not build a Bingo caller?</strong></p>
              <p>If Pop could build a telephone scheduling system using his own recorded voice, he could certainly build a Bingo caller. So he did.</p>
              <p>Using the same core ideas behind QTS, my dad built a <strong>Bingo Calling Application</strong>. He recorded his own voice calling <em>every single Bingo number</em>. Each call was stored individually, mapped perfectly, and played back by the computer.</p>
              <p>When Bingo started, it wasn't a generic voice. It was <strong>Pop</strong>. Calling every number.</p>

              <p>The grandkids loved it.</p>
              <p>They couldn't get enough of hearing Pop's voice calling the numbers. That voice — warm, familiar, unmistakably his — filled the room every Christmas. It brought smiles, laughter, and a deep sense of connection.</p>
              <p>Bingo became more than a game. It became a way for the family to come together. A way to remember. A way for Pop to still be there with us.</p>
              <p>Then came <strong>Christmas 2025</strong> — the first without my dad. He passed away earlier that year.</p>
              <p>My brother hosted Christmas Eve. He had the old Halikan — the computer my dad developed QTS and the Bingo game on — and he powered it up. He said it worked great.</p>
              <p>I got there a few hours later. I tried powering it up. It wouldn't start. A little panic set in.</p>
              <p>After turning the switch on and off a few dozen times... and then a few more dozen times... the screen finally woke up and the machine booted. Relief.</p>
              <p>Then we had to move it to another room. We unplugged it. The on-and-off switching started again. Eventually it booted. But then — of course — we had to move it <em>one more time</em>.</p>
              <p>Finally, we got it set up in its spot. It booted. And we played Bingo.</p>
              <p>It was a great session. Everyone was laughing, having a wonderful time, hearing Pop's voice call out the numbers — like he was right there with us.</p>
              <p>But in the back of my mind, I couldn't shake the thought: <strong>this machine isn't going to last much longer.</strong></p>
              <p>And if we don't do something, we're going to lose this forever. We're going to lose my dad's voice forever.</p>
              <p>That's where I got the idea for this app.</p>

            <div class="story-text story-text--full">
              <p>After Christmas, I brought the Halikan home with me. I had to try.</p>
              <p>The machine wouldn't boot. I pressed the power switch dozens of times. Nothing. The last time that old PC had come to life was <strong>December 24th</strong> — Christmas Eve — the first Christmas without my dad. And now it was silent.</p>
              <p>So I did what my dad would have done. I took it apart.</p>
              <p>I disassembled the Halikan piece by piece, eventually pulling out the hard drive — a tiny 40 MB 3.5-inch IDE drive from the 1980s. I ordered adapters from Amazon. I tried my Mac. I tried my PC. The drive wouldn't mount. It was dead.</p>
              <p>I thought about my friend <strong>Tim</strong>. Tim's a contractor — the kind of guy who can demo a closet, install a pantry, renovate a kitchen. He did work on my house when we sold it, and later helped make my condo livable. But here's the thing about Tim: while he runs his family contracting business, he's also a Vice President at a data storage company. The guy who can gut your bathroom also knows enterprise storage systems.</p>
              <p>I texted him: <em>"Hey Tim, I have a non-home improvement question. I have a 1980s 3.5 inch IDE hard drive that was running on an MS-DOS machine. I need to get the data off this disk."</em></p>
              <p>Tim's response: <em>"I started my journey with computers back in 1980 with MS-DOS. Let me come get it from you."</em></p>
              <p>He picked up the drive that night. He tried his equipment — needed a PATA interface adapter. When that didn't work either, he connected me with <strong>Joe</strong> at a professional data recovery company called <strong>SalvageData</strong> in Cleveland.</p>
              <p>I explained to Joe what was on that drive: <em>"My father wrote a couple of programs with voice files — one for bingo and the other called QTS. I'd like to try to get that software and the sound files."</em></p>
              <p>Tim shipped the drive to Cleveland. A few days later: <strong>"Good news! The evaluation is completed and we are able to recover your data!"</strong></p>
              <p>They salvaged everything. All 75 of Pop's voice recordings. The Bingo program. The QTS system. Everything my dad built, preserved.</p>
              <p>When I downloaded those files and heard my dad's voice come through the speakers — clear as the day he recorded them — I can't describe what that felt like. Decades of Christmas memories. A voice I thought we might lose forever.</p>
              <p><strong>Pop's voice is safe now.</strong> It lives in this app. It lives in the cloud. It will play on Christmas Eve for as long as our family gathers to play Bingo.</p>
              <p>Thanks, Tim. Thanks, Joe. Thanks to everyone who helped bring my dad's voice back.</p>

              <p>Getting the data back was only half the battle.</p>
              <p>When I downloaded the files from SalvageData, I found exactly what I expected: 75 files with no extensions, no headers, no documentation. Just raw binary data from the 1980s. These files were created for the <strong>Big Mouth</strong> ISA sound card — a piece of hardware that predated any audio standards we use today. No WAV headers. No sample rate metadata. Nothing.</p>
              <p>So I did what anyone would do in 2025: I asked AI for help.</p>
              <p>I started with <strong>Claude</strong>, describing the problem and what I knew about the original system. Together, we built an audio tuner app — a web-based tool that could load these mystery files and let me experiment with different decoding parameters. Sample rates. Bit depths. Signed versus unsigned. Mono versus stereo. Every combination imaginable.</p>
              <p>For the first hour, all I heard was static. White noise. Garbage.</p>
              <p>Then, something changed. Through the noise, I heard something familiar. Faint, buried under hiss and distortion, but unmistakable: <em>"B... seven..."</em></p>
              <p>My heart stopped. That was him. That was my dad's voice.</p>
              <p>I knew we were close, but something was still wrong. The audio was there, but corrupted — like listening through a broken radio. We tried everything, but hit a wall.</p>
              <p>So I took what Claude and I had built and showed it to <strong>ChatGPT</strong>. I explained the whole background, showed the code, described what I was hearing. And ChatGPT spotted what we were missing: <strong>the accumulator</strong>.</p>
              <p>The Big Mouth card used <strong>delta encoding</strong> — each byte wasn't an absolute audio sample, it was a <em>change</em> from the previous value. To reconstruct the original waveform, you needed to accumulate those deltas. Without the accumulator, we were just playing back the differences, which sounded like noise with hints of voice buried underneath.</p>
              <p>Once we added the accumulator logic with the right "leak" factor, everything clicked. The static melted away. And there it was — <strong>Pop's voice</strong>, clear as the day he recorded it in the 1980s.</p>
              <p><em>"B-7... I-22... N-31..."</em></p>
              <p>Forty years of technology changes. A dead hard drive. A proprietary format. And two AIs helping me reverse-engineer something my dad built before I was old enough to understand what he was doing.</p>
              <p>The audio tuner we built went through seven versions. Each one got us closer. You can still see them in the project files — a digital archaeology of trial and error.</p>

              <p>I learned a lot from my dad. I'm a lot like him.</p>
              <p>When I see a problem, I want to fix it. That's what he did. That's what he taught me — not with words, but by example. He saw a problem with airplane scheduling, and he fixed it. He saw a way to make Christmas Bingo better, and he built it.</p>
              <p>When that old Halikan struggled to power on Christmas 2025, I saw a problem too. This machine isn't going to last forever. And if it dies, we lose his voice. We lose this piece of him.</p>
              <p>But I could fix it. So I did.</p>
              <p>This app exists to be a <strong>vessel</strong> — to hold my dad's voice and my dad's memory. A small part of his legacy. And in a way, building it is how I honor him. By being like him. By seeing a problem and fixing it.</p>
              <p>And on Christmas Eve, that voice will still be there. Calling the numbers. For as long as we're playing Bingo. For as long as we're using this app. For as long as we gather as a family.</p>
              <p><strong>Pop's Bingo</strong> is a love letter to family, to tradition, and to the voice that will always call the next number.</p>
              <p class="story-thanks"><strong>Thanks, Dad.</strong></p>
              <p class="story-dedication"><em>With love — for Nana, for Mom, for Dad, and for all the generations who gather around the table every Christmas.</em></p>
