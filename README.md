# PopsBingo

PopsBingo is a placeholder repository for a future bingo-style game project.

## Project Goals
- Provide a simple, fun bingo experience.
- Serve as a base for experimenting with front-end and back-end integrations.

## Getting Started
There is no runnable code yet. Planned next steps:
1. Define the game requirements and user interface.
2. Choose a front-end framework (e.g., React) and a lightweight backend or serverless API.
3. Implement the bingo card generation and game logic.

## Contributing
Feel free to open an issue with suggestions or ideas. Pull requests are welcome once an initial architecture is in place.

## License
This project will adopt an open-source license when the first release is published.
