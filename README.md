# 🎄 Pop's Bingo — A Family Story

> *A love letter to family, tradition, and a voice that will always call the next number.*

## ❄️ A Long Island Christmas

My name is **Nick DeMarco**. I grew up in Long Island, New York, raised by an Italian father and a mother whose Irish roots ran deep through my grandmother, **Nana**.

Like many families of that era, heritage was everything during the holidays. Christmas Eve meant honoring tradition — the Italian way. We'd attempt the classic *Feast of the Seven Fishes*, though we adapted it to suit our tastes: **scungilli, calamari, shrimp**, and whatever else we loved. There was always chicken or lasagna for family that didn't like fish. It was never about perfection. It was about being together.

**Nana** would come stay with us around the holidays. Sometimes she lived with us for stretches of time. **Auntie** too. The house would fill with voices — laughing, arguing, storytelling. We were an emotional family, Italian and Irish blood running hot. There were good times and hard times, but what I remember most is the warmth.

And every Christmas Eve, after the food was cleared and the table was set fresh, we played **Bingo**.

## ❄️ Nana Mae — Where It All Began

Before there was code, before there were sound cards and luggable computers, there was **Nana**.

She was my Nana — my mother's mother. Years later, when the great-grandkids came along and my mom became "Nana" to them, we started calling her **Nana Mae** to tell them apart. But to me, she was always just Nana.

Nana was Irish and proud of it. She loved her heritage fiercely. But nothing — *nothing* — compared to how much she loved Bingo.

Nana didn't just enjoy Bingo. She *lived* for it. Bingo was joy, anticipation, community, and ritual all rolled into one. When my wife **Cathie** and I would visit her in Orlando, one of the highlights was taking her to a local bingo hall. Sitting beside her, watching her light up as the numbers were called, you could feel how something as simple as Bingo brought people together.

She also taught me how to argue. How to debate. How to hold my ground. I think of her often, and I miss her deeply. She passed around 1996, but her spirit lives on in every game we play.

Cathie likes Bingo too — but no one loved it like Nana.

That love planted a seed.

## ❄️ Mom Marge — The Director Behind the Scenes

None of this would have happened without **Mom**.

![Mom Marge with grandchildren](photos/mom.jpg)

My mother, **Marge**, was the director behind the scenes for decades. Every Christmas, she'd go out and buy a collection of small, thoughtful, fun prizes. She'd set the table, organize the games, gather the family together.

Pop built the technology. But Mom built the moment.

She was the unsung hero of every Christmas gathering. The one who turned chaos into tradition. The one who made sure everyone felt welcome, fed, and loved. Without her, the Bingo games — and so much else — would never have come together.

Now at 86, she's slowed down — and has graciously passed the torch to my sister **Peggy** and my sister-in-law **Eileen**. Their families are picking up the mantle and spreading out. Peggy's son **Kevin** lives in upstate New York. My brother's kids — **Nicky**, **Ashley**, and **Joey** — still live near home and come together for Christmas Eve.

And even the nephews' wives and girlfriends are joining in, winning prizes, becoming part of the tradition. The circle keeps growing.

## ❄️ Growing Up with Pop's Voice

My dad, **Nick DeMarco**, was a successful business owner who worked relentlessly to provide for his family. But he wasn't just a businessman — he was a problem-solver, a builder, and someone who loved learning new things.

![Pop](photos/pop-portrait.jpg)

In the mid-1980s, he decided to pursue a lifelong dream: **learning to fly**.

Through his friend **Frank**, who worked at Grumman, my dad joined a private pilot club called **GACE**. The club operated a small fleet of Cessna 152s and 172s. Like many clubs at the time, scheduling was painfully manual — you had to drive to the airport, check a paper schedule, and hope a plane was available.

My dad saw the problem. And he fixed it.

Using a piece of ISA hardware called **Big Mouth** — a voice playback board — along with MS-DOS and his own programming skills, he built a **telephone-based aircraft scheduling system**. Members could call in, listen to spoken prompts, and reserve aircraft without ever leaving home.

He called it the **QTS Scheduling System**.

I grew up hearing him develop it. Over and over, I'd hear his voice echoing through the house:

*"Sierra Foxtrot..."*  
*"November Three Four Seven..."*  
*"Cessna One Seven Two..."*

The military phonetic alphabet. Tail numbers. Scheduling prompts. Recorded again and again until they were perfect.

At the time, honestly? It was kind of annoying. Hearing the same phrases repeated endlessly while he got the recordings just right.

But now that he's gone, those memories are precious. That voice — patient, deliberate, unmistakably his — is something I'll never forget.

The same voice that once called airplane tail numbers would later call Bingo numbers.

## ❄️ QTS: Technology Ahead of Its Time

This was the mid-1980s. Personal computers were primitive. There was no internet. No mobile phones. No cloud.

But my dad built something remarkable.

The QTS system was deployed at GACE, and members loved it. So much so that he went on to sell copies to other flying clubs. His work was even written up in a private pilots' magazine — a proud moment that reflected how far ahead of the curve he truly was.

*This was interactive voice technology, built by hand, years before it was commonplace.*

## ❄️ From Airplanes to Bingo

Every Christmas, the family gathered. Mom bought the prizes. The table was set. And then came the question:

**Why not build a Bingo caller?**

![The Halikan Luggable PC](pops_bingo_brief/halikan_luggable.jpeg)

*The Halikan "luggable" IBM-PC compatible that has run Pop's Bingo for over three decades. Built-in CRT, mechanical keyboard, and an ISA sound card that brought Pop's voice to life.*

If Pop could build a telephone scheduling system using his own recorded voice, he could certainly build a Bingo caller.

So he did.

Using the same core ideas behind QTS, my dad built a **Bingo Calling Application**. He recorded his own voice calling *every single Bingo number*. Each call was stored individually, mapped perfectly, and played back by the computer.

When Bingo started, it wasn't a generic voice. It was **Pop**. Calling every number.

## ❄️ A Voice That Never Got Old

The grandkids loved it.

They couldn't get enough of hearing Pop's voice calling the numbers. That voice — warm, familiar, unmistakably his — filled the room every Christmas. It brought smiles, laughter, and a deep sense of connection.

Bingo became more than a game. It became a way for the family to come together. A way to remember. A way for Pop to still be there with us.

Then came **Christmas 2025** — the first without my dad. He passed away earlier that year.

My brother hosted Christmas Eve. He had the old Halikan — the computer my dad developed QTS and the Bingo game on — and he powered it up. He said it worked great.

I got there a few hours later. I tried powering it up. It wouldn't start. A little panic set in.

After turning the switch on and off a few dozen times... and then a few more dozen times... the screen finally woke up and the machine booted. Relief.

Then we had to move it to another room. We unplugged it. The on-and-off switching started again. Eventually it booted. But then — of course — we had to move it *one more time*.

That's when it hit me: **this machine isn't going to last much longer.**

And if we don't do something, we're going to lose this forever. We're going to lose my dad's voice forever.

That's where I got the idea for this app.

## ❄️ Why This Project Exists

This app exists to be a **vessel** — to hold my dad's voice and my dad's memory.

A small part of his legacy.

And on Christmas Eve, that voice will still be there. Calling the numbers. For as long as we're playing Bingo. For as long as we're using this app. For as long as we gather as a family.

**Pop's Bingo** is a love letter to Nana Mae, to Mom Marge, to Pop, and to the generations who gather around the table every Christmas.

## Using Pop's Voice Files

The app automatically loads voice files from the `audio/` folder on startup.

### Current Setup
The repository includes placeholder audio files generated with macOS text-to-speech. These work for testing, but the real magic is Pop's voice.

### Adding Pop's Original Voice
Once we extract the files from the Halikan:

1. Convert the raw PCM files to `.wav` format
2. Name them: `B1.wav`, `B2.wav`, ... `O75.wav`
3. Replace the files in the `audio/` folder
4. Refresh the page

The voice status indicator will show **"Pop's Voice Ready!"** when all 75 files are loaded.
