# PopsBingo

A tribute to a self-taught dad who wrote a family Bingo game in the late 1980s—before most homes even had PCs. For thirty Christmases, this program has called out numbers in living rooms packed with kids, cousins, and grandkids. Now it lives here so the tradition can keep growing.

## The Story
- **Built by Dad:** He wasn’t a professional engineer. He was simply curious and stubborn enough to learn how to code on his own and figured out how to ship a Bingo game when doing that in the 80s was rare.
- **Christmas staple:** Every December, the ritual was the same—boot up the program, print cards, and crowd around the screen. The laughter, the rivalries, the “BINGO!” shouts all trace back to his keyboard.
- **Legacy preserved:** This repository is a way to honor his creativity and keep the game alive for future holidays. Sharing it publicly is an invitation for others to feel the same spark of curiosity he passed down.

## What This Repo Is
- A home for the source code that powered our family Christmas Bingo nights.
- A living archive where we can modernize the app while preserving the original spirit.
- A starting point for anyone who wants to remix or extend the idea for their own traditions.

## How to Contribute
1. Fork the repo and clone it locally.
2. Open an issue if you have stories, bug reports, or feature ideas that keep with the game’s spirit.
3. Submit a pull request with your changes. Be sure to describe how your update keeps the family-fun vibe intact.

## Ideas for Future Updates
- Refresh the UI so it’s easy for kids and grandparents alike.
- Add sound effects or holiday themes that match different family traditions.
- Make it web-friendly so everyone can join from anywhere.
- Document the original implementation details as we uncover them.

## Gratitude
If you grew up with a parent who taught you to be curious, this project is for you. Every line of code here is a thank-you to the dad who showed that you don’t need permission to make something your family loves.
