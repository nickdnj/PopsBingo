              <p>I grew up in Long Island, New York, raised by an Italian father and an Irish mother whose roots ran deep through my grandmother, <strong>Nana</strong>.</p>
              <p>Like many families of that era and still today, heritage was everything during the holidays. Christmas Eve meant honoring tradition — the Italian way. We'd attempt the classic <em>Feast of the Seven Fishes</em>, though we adapted it to suit our tastes: <strong>scungilli, calamari, shrimp</strong>, and whatever else we loved. There was always chicken parmesan or lasagna for family members who didn't like fish. It was never about perfection. It was about being together.</p>
              <p><strong>Nana</strong> would come stay with us around the holidays. Sometimes she lived with us for stretches of time. <strong>Auntie</strong> too. The house would fill with voices — laughing, arguing, storytelling. We were an emotional family, Italian and Irish blood running hot. There were good times and hard times, but what I remember most is the warmth.</p>
              <p>And every Christmas Eve, after the food was cleared and the table was set fresh, we played <strong>Bingo</strong>.</p>

                <p>That Christmas Eve Bingo tradition? It all started with my <strong>Nana</strong> — my mother's mother. Years later, when the great-grandkids came along and my mom became "Nana" to them, we started calling her <strong>Nana Mae</strong> to tell them apart. But to me, she was always just Nana.</p>
                <p>Nana was Irish and proud of it. She loved her heritage fiercely. But nothing — <em>nothing</em> — compared to how much she loved Bingo.</p>
                <p>Nana didn't just enjoy Bingo. She <em>lived</em> for it. Bingo was joy, anticipation, community, and ritual all rolled into one.</p>
                <p>She passed around 1995, but her spirit lives on in every game we play.</p>

                <p>Pop built the technology. But Mom built the moment.</p>
                <p>She was the unsung hero of every Christmas gathering. The one who turned chaos into tradition. The one who made sure everyone felt welcome, fed, and loved. Without her, the Bingo games — and so much else — would never have come together.</p>
                <p>Now at 87, Mom isn't one to easily step aside — and honestly, why would she? This was her tradition to nurture. But my sister-in-law <strong>Eileen</strong>, my sister <strong>Peggy</strong>, and my wife <strong>Cathie</strong> have gently stepped up alongside her.</p>

                <p>My dad, <strong>Nick DeMarco</strong>, was a successful business owner who worked tirelessly to provide for his family. But he wasn't just a businessman — he was a problem-solver, a builder, and someone who loved learning new things.</p>
                <p>In the mid-1980s, he decided to pursue a lifelong dream: <strong>learning to fly</strong>. He joined a private pilot club called <strong>GACE</strong>. Scheduling planes was painfully manual — you had to drive to the airport and check a paper schedule.</p>
                <p>My dad saw the problem. And he fixed it.</p>
                <p>Using a piece of hardware called <strong>Big Mouth</strong> — a voice telephony board — along with MS-DOS and his own programming skills, he built a <strong>telephone-based aircraft scheduling system</strong>. He called it the <strong>QTS System</strong>. Members could call in, listen to spoken prompts, and reserve an aircraft without ever leaving home.</p>

              <p>At the time, honestly? It was kind of annoying. But now that he's gone, those memories are precious.</p>
              <p>The QTS system was deployed at GACE, and members loved it. So much so that he went on to sell copies to other flying clubs. His work was even written up in a private pilots' magazine. <em>This was interactive voice technology, built by hand, years before it was commonplace.</em></p>

                <p>Using the same core ideas behind QTS, my dad built a <strong>Bingo calling application</strong>. He recorded his own voice calling <em>every single Bingo number</em>.</p>

              <p>After Christmas, I brought the Luggable home. The machine wouldn't boot. The hard drive was dead.</p>
              <p>Through a friend who works in data storage, I connected with a professional data recovery company. A few days later: <strong>"Good news! We are able to recover your data!"</strong></p>
              <p>They salvaged everything. All 75 of Pop's voice recordings. The Bingo program. Everything my dad built, preserved.</p>
              <p>But recovering the files was only half the battle. The audio was raw binary data from the 1980s — no headers, no documentation. With the help of AI tools, I built a decoder. For the first hour, all I heard was static. Then, through the noise: <em>"B... seven..."</em></p>
              <p>My heart stopped. That was him. That was my dad's voice.</p>
              <p>After more experimentation, everything clicked. The static melted away. And there it was — <strong>Pop's voice</strong>, clear as the day he recorded it in the 1980s.</p>
              <p><strong>Pop's voice is safe now.</strong> It lives in this app. It will play on Christmas Eve for as long as our family gathers to play Bingo.</p>
