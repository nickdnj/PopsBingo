              <p>My name is <strong>Nick DeMarco</strong>. I grew up in Long Island, New York, raised by an Italian father and a mother whose Irish roots ran deep through my grandmother, <strong>Nana</strong>.</p>
              <p>Like many families of that era, heritage was everything during the holidays. Christmas Eve meant honoring tradition — the Italian way. We'd attempt the classic <em>Feast of the Seven Fishes</em>, though we adapted it to suit our tastes. There was always chicken or lasagna for family that didn't like fish. It was never about perfection. It was about being together.</p>
              <p>And every Christmas Eve, after the food was cleared and the table was set fresh, we played <strong>Bingo</strong>.</p>

              <p>My dad, <strong>Nick DeMarco</strong>, was a successful business owner who loved learning new things. In the mid-1980s, he built a telephone-based aircraft scheduling system using a voice playback board called the <strong>Big Mouth</strong>. He recorded his voice calling airplane tail numbers:</p>

              <p><strong>Christmas 2025</strong> was the first without my dad. He passed away earlier that year.</p>
              <p>The old computer that ran his Bingo program barely powered on. I knew if we didn't do something, we'd lose his voice forever.</p>
              <p>So I recovered the data, reverse-engineered the 40-year-old audio format, and built this app. Now Pop's voice will call the numbers for as long as our family gathers to play Bingo.</p>
              <p><strong>Pop's Bingo</strong> is a love letter to family, to tradition, and to the voice that will always call the next number.</p>
